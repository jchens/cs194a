## Jessica Chen

**Let's Explore** displays a list of maps, each of which show user-defined pins with a title, description, and location. The user can also create a new map.

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Notes

The most challenging part of this project was trying to work around the default theme to customize everything. At one point, I tried adding another theme so the action bar wouldn't show up, but ever after multiple Stack Overflow posts, it wasn't working out. Understanding how to convert vector images into Bitmap images also took quite a while, but it worked out in the end!
