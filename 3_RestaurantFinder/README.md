# Restaurant Finder

## *Jessica Chen*

**Restaurant Finder** extracts a list of search results from the Yelp API and displays the results in a scrollable list.

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Functionality

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] Ability to query the Yelp API to get results from a search query
* [x] The search results are displayed in a RecyclerView

The following **extensions** are implemented:

* [ ] Add a search component in the action bar so the user can query for another item instead of the one hardcoded in the app

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of the app:

## Notes

It was a bit difficult at first adding the search menu option to the app bar and passing in the right parameters to properly handle the intent, but I'm glad it worked out in the end.
